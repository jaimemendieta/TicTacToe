# TicTacToe Game Project

## Description

This project is part of the Software Engineering 2 class at Weber State University. The goal of the project is to develop a TicTacToe game that allows two players to play on a single computer. Additionally, the game will feature a highscores table to keep track of the top performances.

## Instructions to Start the Game

To start the TicTacToe game, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the game is located using the `cd` command:

   ```

3. Once you are in the "tictactoe" directory, start the game using the following command:
